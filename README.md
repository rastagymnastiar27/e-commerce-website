## **TO-D0 for run the project locally**
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Open the project in your code editor** (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Install the necessary packages:**
   
    ````bash
    npm install
   
3. **Open the terminal** and start the JSON server:

## **Note**
Since this is a mini project, it does not include authentication. This means that any user can read, add, edit, or delete jobs without the need for login credentials. The website is designed for simple interaction and testing purposes.
