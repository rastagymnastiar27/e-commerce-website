(The full functional Website (all features and backend) will be available 1-2 weeks from this readme file latest date, stay tuned!

## **Data Source**
The website uses a JSON API to handle and manage job data. [JSON file](https://github.com/rastagymnastiar27/e-commerce-website/blob/main/src/products.json)

## **TO-D0 for Demo**
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Open the project in your code editor** (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Open the terminal** and start the JSON server:
   
   ````bash
   npm run server
   
3. **Install the necessary packages:**
   
    ````bash
    npm install

4. **Run the project:**

    ````bash
    npm run dev

## **Note**
Since this is a mini project, it does not include authentication. This means that any user can read, add, edit, or delete jobs without the need for login credentials. The website is designed for simple interaction and testing purposes.

I will develop this project in the future with new features, stay tuned!
